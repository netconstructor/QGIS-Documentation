+\subsection{What is GPS?}\label{whatsgps}
 
 GPS, the Global Positioning System, is a satellite-based system that allows anyone with a GPS receiver to find their exact position anywhere in the world.
 It is used as an aid in navigation, for example in airplanes, in boats and by hikers.

 Waypoints, routes and tracks are the three basic feature types in GPS data.
 QGIS displays waypoints in point layers while routes and tracks are displayed in linestring layers.

+\subsection{Loading GPS data from a file}\label{label_loadgps}
 
 There are dozens of different file formats for storing GPS data.
 The format that QGIS uses is called GPX (GPS eXchange format), which is a standard interchange format that can contain any number of waypoints, routes and tracks in the same file.

+\subsection{GPSBabel}
 
 Since QGIS uses GPX files you need a way to convert other GPS file formats to GPX.
 This can be done for many formats using the free program GPSBabel, which is available at \url{http://www.gpsbabel.org}.

 Version 1.2.3 of GPSBabel is known to work with QGIS, but you should be able to use later versions without
 any problems.

-\subsubsection{Importing GPS data}
+\subsection{Importing GPS data}
 
 To import GPS data from a file that is not a GPX file, you use the tool \tab{Import other file} in the GPS Tools dialog.
 Here you select the file that you want to import (and the file type), which feature type you want to import from it, where you want to store the converted GPX file and what the name of the new layer should be.  Note that not all GPS 
 data formats will support all three feature types, so for many formats 
 you will only be able to choose between one or two types. 
 
-\subsubsection{Downloading GPS data from a device}
+\subsection{Downloading GPS data from a device}
 
 QGIS can use GPSBabel to download data from a GPS device directly as new vector layers.
 For this we use the \tab{Download from GPS} tab of the GPS Tools dialog (see Figure \ref{figure_download}). Here, we 
 select the type of GPS device, the port that it is connected to (or usb if your GPS supports this), the feature type that you want to download, the GPX file where the data should be stored, and the name of the new layer.

 You can also upload data directly from a vector layer in QGIS to a GPS device using the \tab{Upload to GPS} tab of the GPS Tools dialog. To do this you simply select the layer that you want to upload (which must be a GPX layer), 
 your GPS device type, and the port (or usb) that it is connected to.

 This tool is very useful in combination with the vector editing capabilities of QGIS. It allows you to load a map, create waypoints and routes, and then upload them and use them on your GPS device.

 There are lots of different types of GPS devices.
 The QGIS developers can't test all of them, so if you have one that does not work with any of the device types listed in the \tab{Download from GPS} and \tab{Upload to GPS} tools you can define your own device type for it.
