 \subsubsection{Importing GPS data}
 
 To import GPS data from a file that is not a GPX file, you use the tool \tab{Import other file} in the GPS Tools dialog.
-Here you select the file that you want to import, which feature type you want to import from it, where you want to store the converted GPX file and what the name of the new layer should be.
-
-When you select the file to import you must also select the format of that file by using the menu in the file selection dialog (see figure \ref{figure importdialog}). All formats do not support all three feature types, so for many formats

+data formats will support all three feature types, so for many formats 
 you will only be able to choose between one or two types.

 \subsubsection{Downloading GPS data from a device}
 
-QGIS can use GPSBabel to download data from a GPS device directly into vector layers.
-For this you use the tool \tab{Download from GPS} (see Figure \ref{figure_download}), where you select your type
-of GPS device, the port that it is connected to, the feature type that you want to download, the GPX file where the data should be stored, and the name of the new layer.

-The port is a file name or some other name that your operating system uses as a reference to the physical port in your computer that the GPS device is connected to.
+The port may be a file name or some other name that your operating system uses as a reference to the physical port in your computer that the GPS device is connected to. It may also be simply usb, for usb enabled GPS units.
 \nix On Linux this is something like /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyS1 and on \win Windows it's COM1 or COM2.
 
 When you click \button{OK} the data will be downloaded from the device and appear as a layer in QGIS.
 
 \subsubsection{Uploading GPS data to a device}
 
-You can also upload data directly from a vector layer in QGIS to a GPS device, using the tool \tab{Upload to GPS}.
-The layer must be a GPX layer.
-To do this you simply select the layer that you want to upload, the type of your GPS device and the port that it's connected to.

 \subsubsection{\label{sec:Defining-new-device}Defining new device types}
 
 There are lots of different types of GPS devices.
 The QGIS developers can't test all of them, so if you have one that does not work with any of the device types listed in the \tab{Download from GPS} and \tab{Upload to GPS} tools you can define your own device type for it.
-You do this by using the GPS device editor, which you start by clicking the \button{Edit devices} button in the download or the upload window.
+You do this by using the GPS device editor, which you start by clicking the \button{Edit devices} button in the download or the upload tabs.
 
 To define a new device you simply click the \button{New device} button, enter a name, a download command and an upload command for your device, and click the \button{Update device} button.
 The name will be listed in the device menus in the upload and download windows, and can be any string.
