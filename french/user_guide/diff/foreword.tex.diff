-\textbf{General Improvements}
+\minisec{Symbology labels and diagrams}
 
 \begin{itemize}[label=--]
-\item Added gpsd support to live gps tracking.
-\item A new plugin has been included that allows for offline editing.
-\item Field calculator will now insert NULL feature value in case of calculation error instead of stopping and reverting calculation for all features.
-\item Update srs.db to include grid reference.
-\item Added a native (C++) raster calculator implementation which can deal with large rasters efficiently.
-\item Improved interaction with extents widget in statusbar so that the text contents of the widget can be copied and pasted.
-\item Many improvements and new operators to the field calculator including field concatenation, row counter etc.
-\item Added --configpath option that overrides the default path (~/.qgis) for user configuration and forces QSettings to use this directory, too. This allows users to e.g. carry QGIS installation on a flash drive together with all plugins and settings.
-\item Experimental WFS-T support. Additionally ported wfs to network manager.
-\item Georeferencer has had many tidy ups and improvements.
-\item Support for long int in attribute dialog and editor.
-\item The QGIS Mapserver project has been incorporated into the main SVN repository and packages are being made available. QGIS Mapserver allows you to serve your QGIS project files via the OGC WMS protocol.
-\item Select and measure toolbar flyouts and submenus.
-\item Support has been added for non-spatial tables (currently OGR, delimited text and PostgreSQL providers). These tables can be used for field lookups or just generally browsed and edited using the table view.
-\item Added search string support for feature ids (\$id) and various other search related improvements.
-Added reload method to map layers and provider interface. Like this, caching providers (currently WMS and WFS) can synchronize with changes in the datasource.
+\item New symbology now used by default!
+\item Diagram system that uses the same smart placement system as labeling-ng
+\item Export and import of styles (symbology-ng).
+\item Labels for rules in rule-based renderers.
+\item Font marker can have an X,Y offset.
+\item Line symbology:
+\begin{itemize}[label=--]
+\item Option to put marker on the central point of a line.
+\item Option to put marker only on first/last vertex of a line.
+\item Allow the marker line symbol layer to draw markers on each vertex.
+\end{itemize}
+\item Polygon symbology:
+\begin{itemize}[label=--]
+\item Rotation for svg fills.
+\item Added 'centroid fill' symbol layer which draws a marker on polygon's centroid.
+\item Allow the line symbol layers to be used for outline of polygon (fill) symbols.
+\end{itemize}
+\item Labels
+\begin{itemize}[label=--]
+\item Ability to set label distance in map units.
+\item Move/rotate/change label edit tools to interactively change data defined label properties.

-\item In the table of contents, it is now possible to select and remove or move several layers at once.
+\item Show active crs in status bar.
+\item Assign layer CRS to project (in the legend context menu).
+\item Select default CRS for new projects.
+\item Allow setting CRS for multiple layers at once.
