  Build Virtual Raster & This program builds a VRT (Virtual Dataset) that is a mosaic of the list of input gdal datasets. \\
  \hline Contour & This program generates a vector contour file from the input raster elevation model (DEM).\\
  \hline Rasterize &  This program burns vector geometries (points, lines and polygons) into the raster band(s) of a raster image. Vectors are read from OGR supported vector formats. Note that the vector data must in the same coordinate system as the raster data; on the fly reprojection is not provided.\\
! \hline Polygonize & This utility creates vector polygons for all connected regions of pixels in the raster sharing a common pixel value. Each polygon is created with an attribute indicating the pixel value of that polygon. A raster mask may also be provided to determine which pixels are eligible for processing.
! The utility will create the output vector datasource if it does not already exist, defaulting to GML format.\\
  \hline Merge &  This utility will automatically mosaic a set of images. All the images must be in the same coordinate system and have a matching number of bands, but they may be overlapping, and at different resolutions. In areas of overlap, the last image will be copied over earlier ones. \\
  \hline Sieve & The gdal\_sieve.py script removes raster polygons smaller than a provided threshold size (in pixels) and replaces replaces them with the pixel value of the largest neighbour polygon. The result can be written back to the existing raster band, or copied into a new file.\\
  \hline Proximity & The gdal\_proximity.py script generates a raster proximity map indicating the distance from the center of each pixel to the center of the nearest pixel identified as a target pixel. Target pixels are those in the source raster for which the raster pixel value is in the set of target pixel values.\\
