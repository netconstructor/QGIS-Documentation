An external QGIS plugin is stored in an external svn repository and 
maintained by the individual author. It can be added to QGIS with the Plugin 
installer. QGIS core plugins are maintained by the QGIS Development Team 
and part of every QGIS distribution. You find more information about QGIS 
core plugins in Section \ref{sec:core_plugins}.
