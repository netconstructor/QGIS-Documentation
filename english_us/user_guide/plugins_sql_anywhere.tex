SQL Anywhere is a proprietary relational database management system (RDBMS) 
from Sybase. SQL Anywhere includes spatial support including OGC, shape files 
etc. and built in functions to export to KML, GML and SVG formats.

The \toolbtntwo{sqlanywhere}{SQL Anywhere} Plugin provides a native data provider 
added to QGIS under the GPL v3. The Plugin allows to connect to this SQL 
Anywhere. The \dialog{Add SQL Anywhere layer} dialog is similar in functionality 
to the dialogs for PostGIS and SpatiaLite.
