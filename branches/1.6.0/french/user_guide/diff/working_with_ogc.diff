  A new \toolbtntwo{mIconAddWfsLayer}{Add WFS Layer} icon appears next

+ 
+ QGIS mapserver is an open source WMS 1.3 implementation which, in addition,
+ implements advanced cartographic features for thematic mapping. The QGIS
+ mapserver is a FastCGI/CGI (Common Gateway Interface) application written in
+ C++ that works together with a webserver (e.g. Apache, Lighttpd). 
+ 
+ 
+ It uses QGIS as backend for the GIS logic and for map rendering. Furthermore the 
+ Qt library is used for graphics and for platform independent 
+ C++ programming. In contrast to other WMS software, the QGIS mapserver uses 
+ cartographic rules in SLD/SE as a configuration language, both for the server 
+ configuration and for the user-defined cartographic rules. 
+ 
+ Moreover, the QGIS mapserver project provides the “Publish to Web” plugin, a 
+ plugin for QGIS desktop which exports the current layers and symbology as a 
+ web project for QGIS mapserver (containing cartographic visualisation rules 
+ expressed in SLD).
+ 
+ As QGIS desktop and QGIS mapserver use the same visualization libraries, the
+ maps that are published on the web look the same as in desktop GIS. The 
+ Publish to Web plugin currently supports basic symbolization, with more complex 
+ cartographic visualisation rules introduced manually. As the configuration is 
+ performed with the SLD standard and its documented extensions, there is only 
+ one standardised language to learn, which greatly simplifies the complexity 
+ of creating maps for the Web.
