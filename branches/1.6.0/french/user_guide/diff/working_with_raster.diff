+ The \dialog{Raster Calculator} in the \mainmenuopt{Layer} menu allows to 
+ perform calculations on basis of existing raster pixel values. The results 
+ are written to a new raster layer with a GDAL supported format.

+ 
+ The \textbf{Fields list} contains all loaded raster layers that can be used. 
+ To add a raster to the raster calculator expression field, double
+ click its name in the Fields list. You can then use the operators to construct 
+ calculation expressions or you can just type it into the box.
+ 
+ In the \textbf{Result layer} section you have to define an output layer. You can 
+ then define the extent of the calculation area based on an input raster layer or 
+ based on X,Y coordinates and on Columns and Rows to set the resolution of the 
+ output layer. If the input layer has a different resolution, the values will be 
+ resampled with nearest neighbor algorithm.  
+ 
+ The \textbf{Operators section} contains all usable operators. To add an operator
+ to the raster calculator expression box, click the appropriate button. Mathematical
+ calculations ( + , - , * \dots) and trigonometric functions ( sin, cos, tan, \dots) 
+ are available. Stay tuned for more operators to come!
+ 
+ With the \checkbox{Result to project} checkbox the result layer will automatically 
+ added to the legend area and can be visualized.
