 \subsection{Loading an external QGIS Plugin}\label{sec:load_external_plugin}
 
+External QGIS plugins are written in Python. They are by default stored in either 
+the 'Official' or 'User contributed' QGIS Repositories, or in various other external
+repositories maintained by individual authors. These lists are available 
+automatically from the \filename{Python Plugin installer} via \\
+\dropmenuopttwo{plugin_installer}{Fetch Python Plugins...}.
+
+Detailed documentation about the usage, minimum QGIS version, homepage, authors,
+and other important information are provided with the external plugins themselves
+and is not included in this manual.\footnote{Updates of core plugins may be
+available in this repository as external overlays.}\footnote{fTools, Mapserver 
+Export, and the Plugin Installer are Python plugins, but they are also part of 
+the QGIS sources, and are automatically loaded and enabled inside the QGIS 
+Plugin Manager (see Section~\ref{sec:load_external_plugin}).}
+
+Currently (at the time of testing version 1.7 of QGIS) there are over 120 external 
+plugins available from thirteen listed repositories. Some of these plugins offer
+functionality that will be required by many users (for example : providing the user 
+with the ability to view and edit Open Street Map data, or to add Google Map layers)
+while others offer very specialised functions (for example : Calculate economic pipe diameters
+for water supply networks).
+
+It is, however, quite straightforward to search through all the available external plugins
+by providing keywords, choosing a named repository and/or filtering on the status of plugins 
+(currently installed or uninstalled in your system). Searching and filtering is done from the 
+QGIS Plugin Manager (see Figure~\ref{fig:plugininstaller}).
+
+
+\begin{Tip} \caption{\textsc{Add more repositories}}
+To add the 'User contributed' repository and/or several external author repositories, open the
+Plugin Installer (\mainmenuopt{Plugins} \arrow \dropmenuopttwo{plugin_installer}{Fetch Python Plugins...}),
+go to the \tab{Repositories} tab, and click \button{Add 3rd party repositories}.
+If you do not want one or more of the added repositories, they can be disabled via the
+\button{Edit...} button, or completely removed with the \button{Delete} button.
