-QGIS mapserver is an open source WMS 1.3 implementation which, in addition,
-implements advanced cartographic features for thematic mapping. The QGIS
-mapserver is a FastCGI/CGI (Common Gateway Interface) application written in
-C++ that works together with a webserver (e.g. Apache, Lighttpd). 
-
-
-It uses QGIS as backend for the GIS logic and for map rendering. Furthermore the 
-Qt library is used for graphics and for platform independent 
-C++ programming. In contrast to other WMS software, the QGIS mapserver uses 
-cartographic rules in SLD/SE as a configuration language, both for the server 
-configuration and for the user-defined cartographic rules. 
-
-Moreover, the QGIS mapserver project provides the “Publish to Web” plugin, a 
-plugin for QGIS desktop which exports the current layers and symbology as a 
-web project for QGIS mapserver (containing cartographic visualisation rules 
-expressed in SLD).
-
-As QGIS desktop and QGIS mapserver use the same visualization libraries, the
-maps that are published on the web look the same as in desktop GIS. The 
-Publish to Web plugin currently supports basic symbolization, with more complex 
-cartographic visualisation rules introduced manually. As the configuration is 
-performed with the SLD standard and its documented extensions, there is only 
-one standardised language to learn, which greatly simplifies the complexity 
-of creating maps for the Web.
