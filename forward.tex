Welcome to the wonderful world of Geographical Information Systems (GIS)!
Quantum GIS (QGIS) is an Open Source Geographic Information System. The project
was born in May of 2002 and was established as a project on SourceForge in June
of the same year. We've worked hard to make GIS software (which is traditionaly
expensive commerical software) a viable prospect for anyone with basic access
to a Personal Computer. QGIS currently runs on most Unix platforms, Windows, and
OS X. QGIS is developed using the Qt toolkit (\url{http://www.trolltech.com})
and C++. This means that QGIS feels snappy to use and has a pleasing, easy to
use graphical user interface. 

QGIS aims to be an easy to use GIS, providing common functions and features.
The initial goal was to provide a GIS data viewer. QGIS has reached that point
in its evolution and is being used by many for their daily GIS data viewing
needs. QGIS supports a number of raster and vector data formats, with new
support easily added using the plugin architecture (see Appendix
\ref{appdx_data_formats} for a full list of currenly supported data formats).
QGIS is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Developing QGIS 
under this license means that you can inspect and modify the source code
and guarantees that you, our happy user will always have access to a GIS
program that is free of cost and can be freely modified. You should have
received a full copy of the license with your copy of QGIS, and you also
find it as Appendix \ref{gpl_appendix}.

\subsection{Features}\label{label_majfeat}

QGIS offers a variety of common functionality provided by core features and
plugins.

\minisec{View data}

View and overlay vector and raster data in different formats and
projections without conversion to an internal or common format. Supported
formats include:

\begin{itemize}
\item spatially-enabled PostgreSQL tables using PostGIS, \textbf{most} vector
formats\footnote{OGR-supported formats are not yet supported in QGIS.}
supported by the OGR library, including ESRI shapefiles, MapInfo,
SDTS and GML.
\item all raster formats supported by the GDAL library, such as digital
elevation models, aerial photography or landsat imagery,
\item GRASS mapsets, 
\item Online spatial data served as OGC-compliant WMS or WFS.
\end{itemize}

\minisec{Explore data and compose maps} 

Create maps and interactively explore spatial data with a friendly graphical
user interface. The many helpful tools available in the GUI include:

\begin{itemize}
\item on the fly projection
\item map composer
\item overview panel
\item spatial bookmarks
\item identify/select features
\item edit/view/search attributes
\item feature labeling
\item change vector and raster symbology
\item add a graticule layer
\item decorate your map with a north arrow scale bar and copyright label
\item save and restore projects
\end{itemize}

\minisec{Create, edit and export data}

\begin{itemize}
\item digitizing tools for and shapefile formats and GRASS
\item the georeferencer plugin
\item GPS tools to import and export GPX format, convert other GPS formats to
GPX or down/upload directly to a GPS unit
\end{itemize}

\minisec{Analyse data} 

You can perform spatial data analysis on PostgreSQL/PostGIS and other OGR
supported formats using the geoprocessing plugin. it currently offers buffer,
intersection union, dissolve, difference and convex hull. Or you use the 
integrated GRASS tools, including the complete GRASS functionality, e.g:

\begin{itemize}
\item Image processing (image fusion, classification, filtering, enhancement)
\item Raster analysis (map algebra, terrain analysis, hydrologic modeling
\item Topological vektor analysis (digitizing, union, intersection, buffer)
\item Network analysis (shortest path, travelling salesman)
\end{itemize}

\minisec{Publish maps on the internet}

QGIS can be used to export data to a mapfile and to visualize them in the
internet using a webserver with UMN MapServer installed. QGIS can also
serve as a WMS and WFS server 

\minisec{Extend QGIS functionality through plugins} 

Quantum GIS can be adapted to your special needs through the extensible
plugin architecture, providing libraries that can be used to create plugins
of even new applications with C++ or Python.     

\textbf{Core Plugins}

\begin{itemize}
\item Add WFS Layer
\item Add Delimited Text Layer
\item Decorations (Copyright Label, North Arrow and Scale bar)
\item Georeferencer
\item GPS Tools
\item GRASS integration
\item Graticule Creator
\item SPIT Shapefile to PostgreSQL/PostGIS Import Tool
\item Python Console
\item Python Plugin Installer
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Python Plugins}

QGIS offers to include a growing number of python plugins, provided by the
community. These plugins can be browsed and installed from the official
PyQGIS repository using the python plugin installer.
